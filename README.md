# Coursera_Machine-Learning-with-Python_Capstone-Project

In this project, we build and test different classifiers on the data to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not.
A historical dataset from previous loan applications was loaded. We used the following algorithms to build our models:

1) k-Nearest Neighbour

2) Decision Tree

3) Support Vector Machine

4) Logistic Regression

The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:

Jaccard index

F1-score

LogLoass
